Project Description
CareerCoach is an open-source software designed to help job seekers navigate the complex process of job searching. Our platform provides an all-in-one solution to job seekers to manage their job search process efficiently. The software will enable job seekers to track their applications, their status, and notes about the jobs. In addition, it will provide useful tips and suggestions to improve their resume and cover letters, based on the requirements of the job they are applying for.

Motivation and Background

I've always been interested in creating a platform that helps job seekers and those looking to advance their careers. I've worked on projects in classes such as Database Management and Machine Learning to work on solutions that streamline job application processes and provide a one stop shop for job seekers. In this class, CPSC298, I wanted to explore blockchain integrations that some of my previous solutions could leverage.

Future Work

I hope to continue my work and create a more intuitive platform that utilizes AI to help job seekers connect with companies and hiring managers within their field of interest. As I enter into the workforce, it will be interesting to see how my classwork and idea transform as I continue to learn and grow.
